# Customer Segmentation & Revenue Analysis

## 📌 Description

This Power BI project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on customer transaction data to uncover behavior patterns, segment customers strategically, and guide marketing and revenue decisions. The dashboard provides both business and analytical insights for stakeholders and business owners.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To analyze customer purchasing behavior and segment them into actionable categories such as Champions, At Risk, and Loyal Customers — enabling personalized marketing, improved retention, and targeted sales strategy.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Businesses often collect large volumes of customer data but fail to leverage it to understand their audience. Without segmentation, it's difficult to identify the most valuable or most vulnerable customers. This project solves that by using behavioral data to generate intelligent customer segments and revenue insights.

---

## 🛠 Tools

- Microsoft Power BI  
- SQL Server (Data extraction, cleaning and RFM logic) 
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Git & GitHub
- Notepad++ (Documenting SQL script)

---

## 🔎 Data Discovery

The dataset consists of retail transaction data from a UK-based online store.
Initial exploration revealed issues such as:
- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Negative quantity or price values
- Data inconsistency

These were cleaned in SQL Server before importing into Power BI for analysis.

## 📊 RFM Segmentation Insights

As part of the Online Retail Customer Segmentation Project, performed an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to better understand customer behavior. The segmentation helps identify high-value customers, those at risk of churning, and new opportunities for re-engagement or growth.

### 🔍 Summary of Findings

The customer base shows a large percentage of **inactive or lost customers**, indicating the need for retention strategies. Meanwhile, **Champions** and **Big Spenders**, though small in number, contribute a significantly high share of revenue. Targeted marketing and personalized offers could drive significant business growth by focusing on these high-value groups.
